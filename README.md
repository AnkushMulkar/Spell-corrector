# Spell-corrector
Description
This spell corrector is a program that utilizes lexical processing techniques to automatically correct spelling errors in text. It is designed to improve the accuracy and readability of written content by identifying and suggesting corrections for misspelled words.

The spell corrector uses a lexical approach, which means it focuses on the analysis of individual words rather than the context in which they appear. It relies on a comprehensive dictionary or lexicon to compare and match input words, enabling it to identify potential spelling mistakes and propose alternative corrections.
